This is a small Java project showcasing API integration with a free public API, combined with a simple JavaFX GUI for displaying the results.

Features
✔️ Fetches data from a free API
✔️ Uses a simple approach for making API calls
✔️ Displays results in a JavaFX GUI
✔️ Lightweight and easy to run

Technologies Used
